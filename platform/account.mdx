## Your Accounts

*What are* accounts *and what do you do here?*

In short, accounts - or sub-accounts - match to your GoHighLevel sub-accounts by location ID so that you can have an individual portal for each account in your agency. These accounts are where you will actually build, test, monitor and observe your AI assistants.

Let's go for a tour of each tab and the capabilities & resources associated with growing your AI voice and chat offer.

<Note>
  Your sub-account will automatically begin to pull inbound and outbound conversations for every channel except Email
</Note>

### Inbox

The inbox tab allows you to see conversations picked up by Assistable.ai and stored to become shared permanent conversation memory for the assistants. Once conversations populate, you can select a conversation to see the messages between the contact and your sub-account.

Messages, on the outbound side, are color coded to note the difference in an AI response and a workflow, user or manual action inside of GoHighLevel. AI messages will show up in green, tool calls will show up as objects in the conversation and everything else will be shown in blue.

Tool call messages can be opened up to view meta data for the activity that was performed by the AI during the tool call. For example, I can see the available calendar times being returned to my assistant by opening up the tool call message to observe and triage returns.

AI messages will be color-coded in a black & green gradient along with a voting system for training to your knowledge base. You can select the thumbs up or thumbs down to save the interaction or train for the interaction in the future to a knowledge base.

In the top right of the conversation window, you can see two tabs: Conversation and Server Logs.

* Conversation: Shows the conversation and tool calls associated with the contact.

* Server logs: Shows the transparent server logs for everything that happens for the contact ID. You can view events, connection status during, the AI or tags associated at the time of processing, and meta data.

### Call Center

The call center tab is a top-down view of your calling deployment and a comprehensive list of all AI calls going through the sub-accounts for web, inbound and outbound calls.

You are able to see a briefing of your calls with a total volume graph, result pipeline, campaign and call type data, associated appointments, total call time, average call time and cost-per-booked appointment.

You can generate a branded report by clicking Generate Report in the top right and inputting the dates you want the report for. This will generate a report in the browser and automatically download it to your browser.

The Call List sub-menu allow you to see all calls made by AI for this sub-account. The table shows a brief of call type, to, from, duration in mins, direction, status, ending reason and management buttons for each call. The three buttons on the individual calls allow you to refresh the call data, download the call recording and open a tab to see more granular information for individual calls like transcript, which assistant made the call and more.

### Contacts

The contacts tab is a dormant tab used for memory for the widgets and orbs. This will eventually become a place for bulk calling campaigns, wholistic CRM middleware and stand-alone CRM. You can see visitors who have used your orbs, the associated contact ID inside of GHL, the amount of interactions and some management buttons like syncing with GoHighLevel and opening the contact information drawer to change & edit information for that contact.

### Knowledge

Build, refine and manage knowledge bases for assistants to reference. You can create knowledge bases without file size and data source limits. Each knowledge base can be opened up to upload data into the vector store system.

You can upload data either through plain text, FAQs, any type of file and scraping a URL. Each of these data types will be converted to text, chunked, summarized, reformatted, re-ordered and then embedded to a knowledge base.

After you have uploaded one, or more, data sources to the knowledge base, you will be able to test the knowledge base in the playground to ask questions to get deterministic answers from your knowledge base. these answers can be opened to see the meta data, or vector store return, along with the match score associated with the answers. If the score isn't high enough, the playground will state it doesn't have enough information to answer the question. If the score is above 70%, the AI will use it to respond to the quest. You can also use this area to reinforce answer by adding them back to the knowledge base.

### Assistants

The assistants tab is where you will build, create, share, configure, test and deployment conversational AI.&#x20;

You are able to create assistants in any of 4 ways:

1. Generate for me: We will generate an assistant for you from your description of what you want, your account briefing and best prompting practices in a fine-tuned model. Input a description and we will output a prompt for you.

2. Import with ID: If you have an assistant from the marketplace, in a community or from another sub-account of yours - you can import a snapshot, or duplicate, of that assistant into your account with the ID. This import does not currently pull tools but we have a copy tool by ID.

3. Blank Model: Create a blank canvas AI assistant to start from scratch.

4. Halie Widget: The chat widget inside of the account wasn't trained for you support, that's your job as an agency, it was trained to create assistants for you. Halie widget will converse around what you want, narrow down information and understand what you want in an AI model and will generate assistants for you inside of your account.

You are able to create folders to organize the different AI assistants in your sub-account. Assistants can be managed with the more button (3 dots) which will give you some options:

1. Add & remove favorite: Filter’s your favorite assistants to the top of the list and in it’s own filter category to view.

2. Copy bot ID: Copies the AI's ID to your clipboard which is needed for GoHighLevel workflow actions and other systems like Copy Bot By ID.

3. Duplicate: Duplicated the current assistant in your account.

4. Rename AI: Allows you to change the internal name of the assistant.

5. Move to folder: Move the AI assistant into & out of folders.

6. Configure AI: Opens the AI configuration window.

7. Prevent & allow copy: Allows you to stop or let other users copy your bot by ID. If prevent copy is on, the user will get a notification that you have prevented copying and reject the request.

### Active Tags

Active tags are the trigger for text-based conversational AI responses. You can create active tags for each assistant which syncs a specific tag to GoHighLevel and assigned it to an assistant.

### Numbers > Numbers & Number Pools

Numbers allow you to buy, import and group AI voice numbers to be used in your voice deployment. Buying a number allows you to get a number quickly with no-code and costs only 2.50 per month - this option is only available for United States numbers.

Importing a number can be done with any 3rd party telephony service that allows you to utilize SIP Trunking.

Number pools allows you to group together your numbers and reference them in a round robin style when making AI voice calls.

### Widgets

Create an orb or programmable button to deploy your voice AI on a webpage using an iframe code snippet. These widgets use cookies to create and remember user data with no contact information submission. This allows for no-info booking and remembering a contact.

### Settings

The settings tab allows you to manage your user account, your account information, your account integrations, the members of your account and your wallet balance.

### Help

The help tab is a light, white labeled, help center.
