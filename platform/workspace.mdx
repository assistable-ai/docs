## Your Workspace

*What is your* [*workspace*](https://createassistants.com/dashboard) *and what do you do here?*

When you first create an account, you will create your first workspace during onboarding. Your workspace is where your Agency is hosted. This is where you will manage you client sub-accounts, re-billing, your platform subscription & wallet, white label settings and more.

Let's go for a tour of each tab and the capabilities & resources associated with growing your AI voice and chat offer.

<Note>
  Our workspace & sub-account structure mirrors GoHighLevel's agency & sub-accounts structure just different names.
</Note>

### Launchpad

The [Launchpad](https://createassistants.com/dashboard?page=home) is the all-in-one resources for basic components and overview of your workspace. Here you can find your GoHighLevel Agency Integration & your custom menu link. These two things are the building blocks for connecting Assistable.ai to GoHighLevel and creating sub-accounts.

### Sub-accounts

The Sub-accounts tab is where you will observe, create and manage client sub-accounts for your agency. You will notice a few things you can do here:

1. Create (via Custom Menu Link & Direct Connection) and transfer accounts

2. Manage sub-accounts by clicking on the more button (3 dots):

   1. Adding & removing favorites: Filter's your favorite sub-accounts to the top of the list and in it's own filter category to view.

   2. Open in a new tab: Open's the sub-account portal in a new tab to manage, or remote into, each account without being inside of GoHighLevel.

   3. Edit account: This allows you to edit information about the sub-account client. This information is automatically filled automatically from GoHighLevel on account create & refresh. This is basic information about the client's sub-account like the name, email, number, website, timezone, location ID and Stripe Customer ID (for re-billing).

   4. Manage limits: This allows you to set limits for the sub-account on creation of assistants and numbers, and usage metrics like messages sent and calling minutes.

   5. Edit permissions: This allow you to hide / show specific menu items in the sub-account. You, as the agency admin, will always be able to see all tabs but your client will only see what is selected in the permissions tab.

   6. Invite member: Allows you to send an invitation to a user to become a verified user in the sub-account. The reason you would invite someone to the account is only verified users (i.e. invited users) can manage billing and account settings.

   7. Manage access: Allows you to invite and revoke access to sub-accounts for verified users.

   8. Lock & unlock account: This locks the account with a mask and popup to input your admin password (managed in the Agency tab). This allows you to manage a deployment in full without an unauthorized user or client being able to access the portal without the password.

   9. Connect to GHL: This allow you another view, or option, to manage the sub-accounts oauth connection via the workspace's agency connection or a direct connection.

   10. Turn on re-billing: Switches the account to a re-billing account where metrics for calling are pulled at the sub-account level rather than the workspace level.

   11. \[Hidden until re-billing is turned on] Manage re-billing: Allows you to set your price per minute, input your clients customer ID if you already have one, and give wallet balance to the account.

### Branding

The branding tab allows you to manage your white label for your agency in the Brand sub-menu and add or manage a white labeled domain for the platform in the domain sub-menu.

* Brand: Enter your company logo (any file type is allowed here), company name associated with information relating to the white label and brand hex code (can be inputted if you have one or selected via the color picker).

* Domain: Enter a domain or custom domain to mask the platform for external deployments and console white labeling in the browser.

### Agency

The agency tab allows you to manage / create a new account snapshot, manage your admin password and resend API and resell (if you have the additional reseller license).

You can set enabled features which will set the permissions for newly created sub-accounts in your agency to pre-fill limits and viewing permissions.

In the manage sub-menu, you can see your Admin Lock Password and Resend API. The admin lock password is the password you will input when you lock a sub-account in the sub-account tab. The resend API is where you can connect a Resend API account to send emails from your domains for client reports and notifications.

### Re-Billing

The re-billing tab is where you will connect, and manage the connection, to your Stripe account to enable re-billing to sub-accounts.

### Marketplace

The marketplace, or bot marketplace, is an experimental resource to allow users to connect, post and show off assistants they have created in a Gumroad style marketplace. You can post assistants here for exposure or to share to the entire direct user-base or download the assistants for free during beta.

### Partners

The partners tab is an experimental resource to share companies and individuals who are supporters of Assistable.ai and either have a complimentary service or service that directly relates Assistable.ai.

### Affiliate

The affiliate tab allows you to get compensated for sharing your love of Assistable.ai to other. We offer 30% recurring commission on platform subscriptions.

### Settings

The settings tab allows you to manage your user account, your workspace information, your workspace integrations, the members of your workspace and your wallet balance & subscription.

### Help

The help tab is a light, white labeled, help center.
