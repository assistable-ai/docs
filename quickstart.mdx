  <Accordion title="Create Your Sub-Account" icon="plus">
    There are a few ways to create sub-accounts in your Agency's workspace depending on your business model.&#x20;

    1. **Using Your Custom Menu Link**

       : In your Launchpad or Sub-account tab, you will be able to access your custom menu link. 

       1. Copy Your Custom Menu Link from the popup.

       2. Navigate to app.gohighlevel.com, then 

          **Settings**

          , then 

          **Custom Menu Links**

          .

       3. Create a new custom menu link. Configure it how you would like and paste your custom menu link in the 

          **URL**

           input section. Turn on the menu link for sub-accounts and turn it off for the agency (since your agency does not have a location ID).

       4. Navigate to the sub-account you want to deploy your AI to, and click the custom menu link. The account will automatically be created, connected (if you have an agency level connection) and displayed inside the sub-account.

      Pros to custom menu link:

      * Easy to scale your internal sub-account AI deployment since all it takes to create and connect the account is with a click on the menu link

      * Native and easy integration
    </Check>

    1. Using Direct Connection: In the Sub-account tab when clicking on 

       **Create Account**

       , you can use the direct connection option from the dropdown.

          **Create Account**

           and then click

          **Sub-account**

           you want to create and connect. Allow the custom conversation providers and settings.

       3. You'll be redirected to the newly created and connected Sub-account after the modal. You'll notice this sub-account is now showing inside of your workspace's sub-accounts.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Create Your First Assistant" defaultOpen={false} icon="robot">
    Navigate to your sub-account either inside of GoHighLevel or using the **Open in a new tab** option in the sub-account view in your workspace.



    Once in your sub-account, let's go to the Assistants tab. Once here, there are a few ways to create assistants but let's use the easiest way - generating the assistant for us.



    1. Click on 

       **Create Assistant**

        in the top right corner, then click on 

       **Generate for me**

       .

    2. Input the name of your assistant and a brief description of what you want. If you are unsure of what to input, click on the 

       **Show Example**

        button to see an example.

       1. Name: The name of the assistant is just an internal name - just as you would name a workflow in GoHighLevel.

       2. Description: A brief overview of what you want the assistant to do and how to do it.

    3. After a moment, your assistant will now be created in your sub-account. You can now click on it to see what was generated for the prompt and configure it as you would like.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Deploy In Voice & Chat Channels" defaultOpen={false} icon="phone">
    Your assistants are multi-modal meaning they are not confined to one channel - they are able to converse in both voice and text channels inside of GoHighLevel.



    To converse with your assistant, let's break it down by method of communication:

    <Note>
      A rule of thumb:



      Text based channels (SMS, FB, WhatsApp, IG, etc) require an Active Tag



      Voice-based channels (Inbound, Outbound and Web Calling) require a phone number or a widget
    </Note>

    ## Voice ðŸ“ž

    In order to converse in voice, we are a few ways to do so:

    * Inbound / Outbound Calling

    * Web calling / Orbs

    For inbound and outbound calling, we will need a phone number. This phone number can either be purchased through the platform (US & Canada Only) or imported (via SIP Trunking with any telephony provider that allows SIP Trunking).



    For web calling / orbs, we will need a widget which can be create in the widget tab.



    **<u>Outbound Calling:</u>**

    <Tip>
      Make sure to have a phone number attached to the assistant you want to make a call from
    </Tip>

    1. To make an outbound call, navigate to your GoHighLevel workflows in the automation tab.

    2. Open a workflow or create a workflow where you would like to make a call.

    3. Click on the 'Plus' icon in the workflow to open up the workflow actions - from here, scroll to the bottom and you will see 

       **Make AI Call**

       . Click on that action to add it to the workflow.

    4. Add your assistant ID (your assistant ID can be found in the top left of the assistant configuration under the name), and variables if you would like them. Note: All contact information is pre-filled for you, custom variables are for true custom information.

    5. Run a contact through the workflow. The contact will automatically be called from the assistant ID that was inputted and the conversation, as well as a call briefing, will be added to the contact post-call finish.



    **<u>Inbound Calling:</u>**

    <Tip>
      Make sure to have a phone number attached to the assistant you want to make a call from
    </Tip>

    1. To accept an inbound call, just call your phone number after it has been attached to an assistant.

    2. If you number already exists inside of GoHighLevel, we will pull the information that is available for the contact. If you number does not exist inside of GoHighLevel, we will create a 

       **Guest CallerID**

        inside of your sub-account.

    3. The contact that made the call will receive the conversation, as well as a call briefing, will be added to the contact post-call finish.



    **<u>Web Calling:</u>**

    <Tip>
      Make sure to have a widget attached to the assistant you want to talk with in your browser
    </Tip>

    1. To use the orbs / widgets to make AI calls in your browser, create a widget in the widget tab and connect your assistant.

    2. Copy the code snippet from the orb and place it on your website.

    3. Simply click the orb inside of your browser where you placed it on your website and converse with the assistant.

    4. A 

       **Guest CallerID**

        will be created the first time an orb is used, and consequent uses will remember the information from the contact in GoHighLevel using the cookies we placed in the user's browser.

    5. The contact that made the call will receive the conversation, as well as a call briefing, will be added to the contact post-call finish.

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
    Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
    don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
    your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
    successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
    of the repo.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
    [Commit and push your changes to
    Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
    for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
    the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
    update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
