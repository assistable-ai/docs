    There are a few ways to create sub-accounts in your Agency's workspace depending on your business model.&#x20;

    1. **Using Your Custom Menu Link**

       3. Create a new custom menu link. Configure it how you would like and paste your custom menu link in the

          **URL**

          input section. Turn on the menu link for sub-accounts and turn it off for the agency (since your agency does not have a location ID).

       4. Navigate to the sub-account you want to deploy your AI to, and click the custom menu link. The account will automatically be created, connected (if you have an agency level connection) and displayed inside the sub-account.

  <Accordion title="Create Your First Assistant" defaultOpen={false} icon="robot">
    Navigate to your sub-account either inside of GoHighLevel or using the **Open in a new tab** option in the sub-account view in your workspace.

    Once in your sub-account, let's go to the Assistants tab. Once here, there are a few ways to create assistants but let's use the easiest way - generating the assistant for us.

    1. Click on

       **Create Assistant**

       in the top right corner, then click on

       **Generate for me**

       .

    2. Input the name of your assistant and a brief description of what you want. If you are unsure of what to input, click on the

       **Show Example**

       button to see an example.

       1. Name: The name of the assistant is just an internal name - just as you would name a workflow in GoHighLevel.

       2. Description: A brief overview of what you want the assistant to do and how to do it.

    3. After a moment, your assistant will now be created in your sub-account. You can now click on it to see what was generated for the prompt and configure it as you would like.

  <Accordion title="Deploy In Voice & Chat Channels" defaultOpen={false} icon="phone">
    Your assistants are multi-modal meaning they are not confined to one channel - they are able to converse in both voice and text channels inside of GoHighLevel.

    To converse with your assistant, let's break it down by method of communication:

    <Note>
      A rule of thumb:

      Text based channels (SMS, FB, WhatsApp, IG, etc) require an Active Tag

      Voice-based channels (Inbound, Outbound and Web Calling) require a phone number or a widget
    </Note>

    ## Text / Chat ðŸ“ž

    In order to converse in chat channels, we just need an Active Tag on the contact to process the response. The basics of how it works, if there is an active tag on the contact - the assistant corresponding to that active tag will respond. If there is not an active tag on the contact - no assistants will respond but the message will be stored for memory in the future.



    **<u>What is an Active Tag?</u>**

    The reason we are able to work with no workflows, API calls or webhooks is because of our application layer of Active Tags. We collect all inbound and outbound messages (except email) and store them in a permanent conversation memory. So how would we know when to reply? and with which assistant to reply? We do this with active tags.



    They are tags that are "looked for" when a message comes through from a contact. If we see an active tag, we find the assistant that correlates with the active tag that we found and send the response from that specific AI.

    <Tip>
      Navigate to the Active Tags tab, create an active tag, connect an assistant, create the actual tag to link to the assistant and save the changes.



      The tag will automatically be added to GoHighLevel for you (as long as there is an active and live connection between Assistable.ai and GoHighLevel)
    </Tip>



    1. Navigate to the contact you want to converse with and add your active tag.

    2. When an inbound message comes from that contact (i.e. you message your GoHighLevel number, chat widget, or social media account), we will see your active tag, match it to the assistant and generate the response.



    ## Voice ðŸ“ž

    In order to converse in voice, we are a few ways to do so:

    * Inbound / Outbound Calling

    * Web calling / Orbs

    For inbound and outbound calling, we will need a phone number. This phone number can either be purchased through the platform (US & Canada Only) or imported (via SIP Trunking with any telephony provider that allows SIP Trunking).

    For web calling / orbs, we will need a widget which can be create in the widget tab.

    **<u>Outbound Calling:</u>**

    <Tip>
      Make sure to have a phone number attached to the assistant you want to make a call from
    </Tip>

    1. To make an outbound call, navigate to your GoHighLevel workflows in the automation tab.

    2. Open a workflow or create a workflow where you would like to make a call.

    3. Click on the 'Plus' icon in the workflow to open up the workflow actions - from here, scroll to the bottom and you will see

       **Make AI Call**

       . Click on that action to add it to the workflow.

    4. Add your assistant ID (your assistant ID can be found in the top left of the assistant configuration under the name), and variables if you would like them. Note: All contact information is pre-filled for you, custom variables are for true custom information.

    5. Run a contact through the workflow. The contact will automatically be called from the assistant ID that was inputted and the conversation, as well as a call briefing, will be added to the contact post-call finish.

    **<u>Inbound Calling:</u>**

    <Tip>
      Make sure to have a phone number attached to the assistant you want to make a call from
    </Tip>

    1. To accept an inbound call, just call your phone number after it has been attached to an assistant.

    2. If you number already exists inside of GoHighLevel, we will pull the information that is available for the contact. If you number does not exist inside of GoHighLevel, we will create a 

       **Guest CallerID**

        

       inside of your sub-account.

    3. The contact that made the call will receive the conversation, as well as a call briefing, will be added to the contact post-call finish.

    **<u>Web Calling:</u>**

    <Tip>
      Make sure to have a widget attached to the assistant you want to talk with in your browser
    </Tip>

    1. To use the orbs / widgets to make AI calls in your browser, create a widget in the widget tab and connect your assistant.

    2. Copy the code snippet from the orb and place it on your website.

    3. Simply click the orb inside of your browser where you placed it on your website and converse with the assistant.

    4. A 

       **Guest CallerID**

        

       will be created the first time an orb is used, and consequent uses will remember the information from the contact in GoHighLevel using the cookies we placed in the user's browser.

    5. The contact that made the call will receive the conversation, as well as a call briefing, will be added to the contact post-call finish.
